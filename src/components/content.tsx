        description: "Review crypto's failure modes in the context of agents, and how shifting focus to stateless execution puts us on a better track in the technology growth cycle.",
        body: "Stateless execution reframes how agentic software can remain deterministic while still benefiting from probabilistic language models. We explore the trade-offs across client engineering, transaction safety, and context compilation—highlighting why the stateless model offers better upgradability and sharper risk envelopes for autonomous systems.",

        description: "How we evolve from MCP-based design to native execution support in blockchain light clients, optimized with context compilation and type safety in LLM processing.",
        body: "LLM infrastructure demands stronger guarantees than MCP can provide. In this post we break down our compiler-inspired approach to intent capture, the routing mesh that sits between wallet agents and chain simulators, and the instrumentation that keeps the whole pipeline observable.",
